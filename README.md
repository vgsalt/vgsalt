- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vgsalt
- ðŸ‘€ I'm kind of OK with coding as a hobby, it's not something I want to work with as a job because I do get burnt out. However I do enjoy IT!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning things myself and a little bit at school (though I wish I was just at work already)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can send me an e-mail if you know it
